## You have to learn 6,000 words to start using language comfortably.

Even if you are a very dedicated student who learns five new words daily, it will take you years to remember them.

### How are you going to discover and learn these many words?

Vocably has the answer to this question: you should start using the language in your life:

- Google in your target language
- Consult with AI in your target language
- Read news in your target language

Vocably will help you translate any words you see on your screen and then help you learn these words with one of the most efficient and scientifically proven methods â€” spaced repetition.
