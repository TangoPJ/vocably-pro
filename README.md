# Become Fluent in a Foreign Language

## You must learn 6,000 words to use language comfortably and 12,000 to sound like an adult

It will take years, even if you are a dedicated student who learns five new words daily.

There is no magic pill that inserts those words into your head.

That's why language learning takes so much time.

Methods that promise fast results lie. Learning thousands of words is not fast.

### How are you going to find and learn these many words?

Vocably has the answer to this question: you should start using the language in your life:

- Google in your target language
- Consult with AI in your target language
- Read news in your target language

Vocably will help you translate any words you see on your screen and then help you learn these words with one of the most efficient and scientifically proven methods â€” spaced repetition.

## How it works

1. Select any word (or phrase) you don't understand (supports Chrome, Safari, iOS Safari, Android, and YouTube on Desktop).
1. Translate it + Add it to your collection.
