  <p>Vocably loves and supports people who study multiple languages.</p>

  <p>I won't lie; the multi-lang functionality is a bit clumsy.</p>

  <p>
    It exists, but it is not as good as the rest of functionality. I will fix
    it. I promise.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you still want to give Vocably a chance, let's try it with the language
    in which you are most invested.

    project features.
