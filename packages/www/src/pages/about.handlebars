    <p>
      Hi, I’m Dmytro Snisarenko. An <a href="https://github.com/sneas" target="_blank">indie developer</a> from Ukraine who has been living in the Netherlands since 2014.

    <p>Even though I studied English at school, the relocation showed that I should invest into my language learning way more than I did. A friend of mine has suggested <a href="https://www.antimoon.com/how/howtolearn.htm" target="_blank">this method</a> which I found compelling. It worked miracles but step 6 of the method - SRS - was quite difficult. Not the SRS method itself - it’s wonderful and I use it every time I have leisure access to my mobile. The “add English words and phrases to it” part is tedious. There are plenty of nice SRS applications, but none of them have a browser extension which lets adding flashcards automatically while surfing the web. I wanted flash cards to be added as easy as using Google Translate, otherwise I lost context while adding flashcards via a mobile or web app. There are some chrome extensions that indent to combine Google Translate and SRS. But I wanted my flashcards to have definitions. Also I wanted my flashcards to be in “normal” format i.e.: singular form for nouns and infinitive for verbs. Also the flashcards must be available on mobile so I can learn them while sitting in toilet. None of platforms could give me that, so being a developer, I created one myself. It works for me. In the last 4 months I significantly improved my understanding of Dutch. I’m still far from being fluent, but at least I can read in Dutch almost fluently which is definitely a good start. I hope you’ll find this app as useful as I do.
