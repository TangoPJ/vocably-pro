      If you are just starting with language learning, then popular apps like Duolingo or Babbel will be a better fit you. They’re designed to help you progress from level A0 (beginner) to level A2 (enough skill to order a table at a restaurant). On this journey, you'll learn basic grammar and expand your vocabulary by 2,000–4,000 words.

      To practice saved flashcards, Vocably uses the spaced repetition method (also known as Spaced Repetition System, or SRS). This technique, developed over a century ago, is designed to help you memorize large volumes of information. It forms the basis of popular programs like Anki, Quizlet, and Memrise.
