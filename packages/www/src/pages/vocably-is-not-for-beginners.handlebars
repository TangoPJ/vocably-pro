    <p>
      If you are just starting with language learning, then apps like Duolingo or Babbel are a better fit you. They’re designed to help you progress from level A0 (beginner) to A2 (enough skill to book a table at a restaurant). On this journey, you'll learn basic grammar and expand your vocabulary by 2,000–4,000 words.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h4">Progressing towards intermediate and advanced levels (B1 - C2)</h2>

    <p>
      To reach levels B1 (enough language skill to work as a cashier in a supermarket) to C2 (able to speak fluently on any familiar topic), you need a solid understanding of grammar and a vocabulary of 5,000–20,000 words. As you work towards B1-C2, you'll eventually realize that apps alone won’t get you there. You'll need to start using the language.

    <h2 class="h4">Vocably is for those who use a foreign language in real life</h2>

    <p>Vocably browser extension and mobile app will help you to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Quickly translate any unfamiliar word or phrase</li>
      <li>Save that word or phrase as a flashcard</li>
      <li>Learn the saved flashcard</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Flashcards created with Vocably include the translation, part of speech, transcription, gender, definition, and an example of use.

    <p>Translate with Vocably in the following situations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You see an unfamiliar word in the browser or on your mobile screen</li>
      <li>You hear a word or see it on the street</li>
      <li>You want to say something in a foreign language but don’t know the right word</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h4">Language learning is mostly about memorizing words and phrases</h2>

    </div>

    <p>
      To practice saved flashcards, Vocably uses the spaced repetition method (also known as Spaced Repetition System, or SRS). This technique, developed over a century ago, is designed to help you memorize large volumes of information. It forms the basis of popular programs like Anki, Quizlet, and Memrise.
