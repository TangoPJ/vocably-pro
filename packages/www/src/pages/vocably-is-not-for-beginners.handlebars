    <h1 class="h2 text-center">Vocably is not for beginners</h1>
    <p>Vocably is created to help people translate and remember words and short phrases.</p>

    <p>Let me explain why it might not be ideal for beginners. Take the first paragraph of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland as an example:</p>

    <p class="text-example" data-nosnippet>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'</p>

    <p>If the above fragment makes as much sense to you as this one:</p>

    <p class="text-example" data-nosnippet>Alice was<span class="blur blur-4"> beginning to get </span>very<span class="blur blur-4"> tired of</span><span class="blur blur-1"> sitting </span><span class="blur blur-4">by her </span>sister<span class="blur blur-4"> on the</span><span class="blur blur-2"> bank</span>, and <span class="blur blur-4"> of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the </span>book<span class="blur blur-4"> her </span>sister<span class="blur blur-2"> was reading, </span><span class="blur blur-4">but it had no </span>pictures<span class="blur blur-4"> or conversations </span>in it, '<span class="blur blur-2">and what is the use of a</span> book,'<span class="blur blur-4"> thought </span>Alice '<span class="blur blur-4">without </span>pictures<span class="blur blur-4"> or conversation</span>?'</p>

    <p>Your vocabulary and grammar are at a beginner level, and it’s unlikely you’ll understand the meaning of the sentence even after translating each word.</p>

    <p>
      If you’re just starting to learn a language, courses combined with apps like Duolingo or Babbel can help you grasp the basics of grammar. Flashcard apps like Anki or Quizlet can help you grow your vocabulary by 2,000–4,000 words or even more.
    </p>

    <p>After progressing from level A0 (beginner) to A2 (enough skill to book a table at a restaurant) the text will look like this:</p>

    <p class="text-example" data-nosnippet>Alice was beginning to get very <span class="blur blur-4"> tired </span>of sitting<span class="blur blur-2"> by her </span>sister on the<span class="blur blur-2"> bank</span>, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had <span class="blur blur-4">peeped</span> into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or <span class="blur blur-4">conversations</span> in it, '<span class="blur blur-2">and what is the use of a book,</span>' thought Alice 'without pictures or <span class="blur blur-4">conversation</span>?'</p>

    <p>It’s still not entirely clear, but it makes more sense. If your goal is to fully understand the text, you’ll need to level up.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Progressing towards intermediate and advanced levels (B1 - C2)</h2>

    <p>
      To reach levels B1 (enough language skill to work as a cashier in a supermarket) to C2 (able to speak fluently on any familiar topic), you need a solid understanding of grammar and a vocabulary of 5,000–20,000 words. As you work towards B1-C2, you'll eventually realize that apps alone won’t help you. You'll need to start using the language.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h4">Vocably is for those who use a foreign language in real life</h2>

    <p>Vocably browser extension and mobile app will help you to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Quickly translate any unfamiliar word or phrase</li>
      <li>Save that word or phrase as a flashcard</li>
      <li>Remember the saved flashcard</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="mb-3">
      Flashcards created with Vocably include the translation, part of speech, transcription, gender, definition, and an example of use.
    </p>

      <img style="border-radius: 2rem;" src="assets/card-explained.png" width="100%" alt="How regular translation looks like" />
    </div>

    <p>Translate with Vocably in the following situations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You see an unfamiliar word in the browser or on your mobile screen</li>
      <li>You hear a word or see it on the street</li>
      <li>You want to say something in a foreign language but don’t know the right word</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="h4">Language learning is mostly about memorizing words and phrases</h2>

        <img src="assets/vragen-quiz.png" width="100%" alt="Quiz example" />
      </iphone-16-max>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 4rem;">
      To practice saved flashcards, Vocably uses the spaced repetition method (also known as Spaced Repetition System, or SRS). This technique, developed over a century ago, is designed to help you memorize large volumes of information. It forms the basis of popular programs like Anki, Quizlet, and Memrise.
